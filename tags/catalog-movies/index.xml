      <description>An earthquake &amp;ldquo;catalog&amp;rdquo; is the list of time, location, magnitude, depth and other parameters describing the energy released by the earthquake. We generate dots and synchronous sounds marking each event, to generate movies with soundtracks for a region and time window, such as these:
Tohoku: vimeo.com/153547571
Haiti: vimeo.com/153547570
The sounds for each earthquake magnitude are sampled from small aftershocks of sonified data from the Mag6.6 Niigata, Japan earthquake of 2007.</description>

      <title>20 Years of Global Earthquakes (1993-2013)</title>
      <link>/movies/globalcmt1993-2013/</link>

      <description>This movie shows all events recorded in the Global CMT catalog from 1993 to 2013 of magnitude 5.4 and above. The time scale is 10 seconds per year.
Earthquake magnitude and location are displayed by a circle and simultaneous audio event. The circle diameter is exponentially mapped to magnitude. The audio events are synthesized to scale continuously with earthquake magnitude in pitch, decay-time and overtone content.</description>

      <description>This movie shows earthquakes from California larger than Magnitude 2, in the years between 2001-2007. The Magnitude 6.2 San Simeon and Magnitude 6.0 Parkfield earthquakes are clear, along with their many aftershocks. The dot size is (non-linearly) proportional to magnitude and the color is proportional to depth according to these rules:
Key: vimeo.com/153547572.
The sound is generated by adding to the sound track tiny earthquake sounds, as described by that link.</description>

      <description>This movie shows earthquakes in the Caribbean region larger than Magnitude 3.5 (about 8,000 events), in the years between Jan. 1, 2008 - Dec. 31, 2014. The Magnitude 7.0 Haiti earthquake was on January 12, 2010. This movie covers same time window and distance in latitude (but not longitude) as the movie on the Japan region and Tohoku Mag9.0 earthquake: vimeo.com/153547571.
The dot size is (non-linearly) proportional to magnitude and the color is proportional to depth according to these rules:</description>

      <description>This movie shows earthquakes from Japan larger than Magnitude 3.5 (more than 10,000 events), in the years between Jan. 1, 2008 - Dec. 31, 2014. The Magnitude 9.0 Tohoku-oki earthquake was on March 11, 2011 (note the title bar in the movie says 2012, which is incorrect!). This is the same time window and distance in latitude (but not longitude) as the movie on the Caribbean and Haiti M7.</description>
