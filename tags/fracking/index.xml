      <description>In some cases, hydrocarbon and geothermal heat extraction processes cause earthquakes. Listening to various settings where these occur clearly conveys the differences between human-induced and tectonic earthquakes, and raises many interesting societal questions.
Wastewater from shale gas extraction by &amp;ldquo;fracking&amp;rdquo; is toxic enough that most states will not allow it to be stored or disposed of in-state. Oklahoma and Ohio permitted wastewater to be injected deep in the ground. The injection occurs at high pressure so that the fluid flow deep into some deep layer in the crust and will stay.</description>
