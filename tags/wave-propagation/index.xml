      <description>This movie shows the seismic wave field in the Earth for two hours after the Tohoku Magnitude 9.0 earthquake on March 11, 2011. The sounds are real seismic data taken from 8 seismometers on a great circle around the globe, and sped up into the sonic range. The first two sequences are filtered to emphasize surface waves and the second two filtered to emphasize body waves. The simulation was performed by Daniel Peter using SPECFEM3D and rendered with ``yt&amp;rdquo; (yt-project.</description>

      <description>This movie is about a cutting edge topic in seismology: the study of the ambient noise field in the Earth. We show the average ocean wave height in the northern hemisphere oceans, and you hear the ambient seismic noise for the entire year of 2012, in which Hurricane Sandy occurred in the Atlantic ocean. One year is compressed to 4 minutes and 53 seconds.
Why do we juxtapose this animation with this sound?</description>

      <description>Audiovisual demonstration where traveling waves are generated by the sum of many standing waves (normal modes) at the Earth&amp;rsquo;s surface.
VIDEO: shows 9 of Earth&amp;rsquo;s observable lowest frequency normal modes (color rings) with tones corresponding to the center frequency of each mode. Higher frequency modes are represented by cool colors and low frequencies by warm colors. The outer ring (white) represents the sum of the colored rings.</description>
