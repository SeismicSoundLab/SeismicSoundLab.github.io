      <description>Every volcano has a wide range of processes going on inside that generate seismic waves. Some of these are &amp;lsquo;normal&amp;rsquo; earthquakes, some are tremors associated with magma moving around in its plumbing. We will build more movies of other volcanoes soon, but for now, here is our rough draft of catalogs from the Kilauea eruption of 2018. Listen for the cyclic patterns in the following movie. We have never seen this kind of pattern in an eruption, and are working to understand how this happens:</description>

      <title>Geysers and Volcanoes: Scaling by Analogy</title>

      <description>Geysers are hydrothermal features that episodically erupt liquid and vapor. The eruptions that we see at the surface are the culmination of a complex series of processes below the ground hidden from direct observation. But that doesn’t mean they are hidden entirely; we can monitor them with various sensors to record different aspects of the system. For example, a tilt meter can measure the inflation of the ground due to pressure build up before an eruption, and a seismometer can measure hydrothermal ‘tremor’, which tells us about the bubbling of the hot liquid.</description>

This movie is a work in progress! 10 years of data from Kilauea volcano, from 2000-2010. We produced this (collaboration with Leif Karlstrom) about a week before the huge eruptions of 2018 started!
