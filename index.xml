      <description>To start with, here is a famous recording to illustrate the kinds of sounds we actually hear during an earthquake, from the 1976 Friuli earthquake in Italy:   A boy was transferring his Pink Floyd record to cassette by holding a microphone up to the speaker connected to the turntable. When the first wave arrived, the P-wave (or compressional wave), the needle jumped. Then the second, larger set of waves arrived, the S-waves (or shear waves).</description>

      <description>First, plate motions (plate tectonics) on Earth is driven by the convection of the deep interior, or mantle. Here&amp;rsquo;s a movie of convection over two billion years, BILLION!, sped up to play in 36 seconds:
  If we slow way down, we can look at and hear something like what those plates sound like as they grind past each other and cause earthquakes. To do so, we animate the data with sound, using these rules to generate these movies of ``earthquake catalogs&amp;rdquo;, or lists of earthquakes by location, date, magnitude, etc.</description>

      <description>Every volcano has a wide range of processes going on inside that generate seismic waves. Some of these are &amp;lsquo;normal&amp;rsquo; earthquakes, some are tremors associated with magma moving around in its plumbing. We will build more movies of other volcanoes soon, but for now, here is our rough draft of catalogs from the Kilauea eruption of 2018. Listen for the cyclic patterns in the following movie. We have never seen this kind of pattern in an eruption, and are working to understand how this happens:</description>

      <description>In some cases, hydrocarbon and geothermal heat extraction processes cause earthquakes. Listening to various settings where these occur clearly conveys the differences between human-induced and tectonic earthquakes, and raises many interesting societal questions.
Wastewater from shale gas extraction by &amp;ldquo;fracking&amp;rdquo; is toxic enough that most states will not allow it to be stored or disposed of in-state. Oklahoma and Ohio permitted wastewater to be injected deep in the ground. The injection occurs at high pressure so that the fluid flow deep into some deep layer in the crust and will stay.</description>

      <description>Solar insolation is a measure of how much of the sun’s energy hits the Earth’s surface. This energy drives the climate and weather of our planet. The seasons are caused by the planet’s tilt&amp;mdash; half of the planet is closer to the sun in Summer than in Winter. However, solar insolation itself can vary on timescales from tens to hundreds of thousands of years, as a result of changes in the planet’s tilt and the shape of its orbit.</description>

      <description>Geysers are hydrothermal features that episodically erupt liquid and vapor. The eruptions that we see at the surface are the culmination of a complex series of processes below the ground hidden from direct observation. But that doesn’t mean they are hidden entirely; we can monitor them with various sensors to record different aspects of the system. For example, a tilt meter can measure the inflation of the ground due to pressure build up before an eruption, and a seismometer can measure hydrothermal ‘tremor’, which tells us about the bubbling of the hot liquid.</description>

      <description>An earthquake &amp;ldquo;catalog&amp;rdquo; is the list of time, location, magnitude, depth and other parameters describing the energy released by the earthquake. We generate dots and synchronous sounds marking each event, to generate movies with soundtracks for a region and time window, such as these:
Tohoku: vimeo.com/153547571
Haiti: vimeo.com/153547570
The sounds for each earthquake magnitude are sampled from small aftershocks of sonified data from the Mag6.6 Niigata, Japan earthquake of 2007.</description>

      <description>(We did not make this one!) From the youtube site:
This is the sonorous recording of the first one shake of the Friuli&amp;rsquo;s earthquake (north Italy). A Tricesimo&amp;rsquo;s boy, Mario Garlatti, was pouring again a passage of the Pink Floyd from the turntable to the cassettes recorder. The microphone, remained on, it has recorded a dramatic sequence: the arm of the turntable that jumps, the noise provoked by the shake and the terror in the house.</description>

      <description>This movie shows all events recorded in the Global CMT catalog from 1993 to 2013 of magnitude 5.4 and above. The time scale is 10 seconds per year.
Earthquake magnitude and location are displayed by a circle and simultaneous audio event. The circle diameter is exponentially mapped to magnitude. The audio events are synthesized to scale continuously with earthquake magnitude in pitch, decay-time and overtone content.</description>

      <description>This movie shows the seismic wave field in the Earth for two hours after the Tohoku Magnitude 9.0 earthquake on March 11, 2011. The sounds are real seismic data taken from 8 seismometers on a great circle around the globe, and sped up into the sonic range. The first two sequences are filtered to emphasize surface waves and the second two filtered to emphasize body waves. The simulation was performed by Daniel Peter using SPECFEM3D and rendered with ``yt&amp;rdquo; (yt-project.</description>

      <description>This movie shows earthquakes from California larger than Magnitude 2, in the years between 2001-2007. The Magnitude 6.2 San Simeon and Magnitude 6.0 Parkfield earthquakes are clear, along with their many aftershocks. The dot size is (non-linearly) proportional to magnitude and the color is proportional to depth according to these rules:

      <description>This movie is about a cutting edge topic in seismology: the study of the ambient noise field in the Earth. We show the average ocean wave height in the northern hemisphere oceans, and you hear the ambient seismic noise for the entire year of 2012, in which Hurricane Sandy occurred in the Atlantic ocean. One year is compressed to 4 minutes and 53 seconds.
